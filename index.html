								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>TraizelCraft was started back in 2012 on the Xbox 360 edition of 
										Minecraft by a guy named Traizel. Over the years, his 
										great creation grew into something he wanted to show off. One day, that became
										a reality when he started to show players his massive build. It only took a few months until 
										several people were in love with his 
										creation and wanted to see more. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>Traizel continued to build not only 
										his Minecraft world, but what was going to become a growing community of 
										wonderful people. Today, TraizelCraft Network is more, and Traizel continues 
										to build and grow with his community he has built, and has several plans for 
										the upcoming future.
